# GEgraph
Contact tracing graph for Geneva canton

This data is based on real data, BUT is a non-representative sample, with significant noise introduced and some addtional permutations added for privacy reasons.

We include scripts to import this data into Neo4J.

This is a preliminary release. We do not think our scripts are very robust, and they can definitely be improved. Please file issues accordingly. 

We hope this data might be useful in assessing the contact tracing strategies, their proportionality with respect to results, and in developing an interoperable framework across borders for opertations but also assessment of efficacy. 

With thanks to those who devoted time to this project within the [Cantonal Health Authority of Geneva canton](https://www.ge.ch/organisation/service-du-medecin-cantonal).
